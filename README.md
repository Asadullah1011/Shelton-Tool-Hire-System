# Back-End Design
High-level web framework Python Django enables quick development and simple, effective design. The many built-in capabilities of Django, including an ORM for database interaction, a templating engine, and an authentication system, add to the effectiveness and scalability of the framework. Moreover, developer cooperation is improved when Django is integrated with a version control system such as Git. Git provides a methodical approach to code versioning, allows for the tracking of changes, and allows the management of several branches for features or bug solutions.

5.2.1. Database Management:
•	SQLite for lightweight yet powerful data storage, integrated seamlessly with Django.
•	Django's ORM for effective database querying and manipulation, simplifying data handling and reducing the need for complex SQL queries.
